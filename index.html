Complete the following steps. Once you are done create a new repository in github, deploy this file to github and send a link to the project in Google Classroom
1. add an h1 tag with your name (hint try using emmet by typing h1 and hit tab)



2. Add a photo of yourself below your h1 heading

3. Below your photo add an h2 tag with a caption that describes the photo. The size won't' make sense for a caption but we will edit this later with CSS
 

4. Below your link create an unordered list with multiple list items in it. The list items should include a timeline about you, facts about you, or you can have two lists that include both.

5. Add a link at the bottom of your page that links to your linkedIn account.

6. If you want to go above and beyond and extra flourishes to you page, that would be encouraged and celebrated!

7. Deploy this page to your github and submit the link to your repository. Make sure that everything works on Live Server before you deploy your page!
